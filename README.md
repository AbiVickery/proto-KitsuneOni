# proto-KitsuneOni

This is a website I was commissioned to create for the Kitsune-Oni VTuber Miss Abby Curry...
Due to what has been happening to channel clippers on Youtube lately (as well as other bs i'm not going into right now), she has expressed wanting her own website to publish her stream and brand related stuff on in case Youtube execs decide to go nuclear or something {her words, not mine}.

I will be in charge of keeping the site up to date (when it goes live) and maintaining it. Right now, this is just the prototype for the main site. This will not be the final design, this is really more just the blue print for the actual site.

If you have questions/buisness inquires, ask me here or through email (vickeryabi@gmail.com).
If you have questions for Abby Curry, reach out to her through either her Twitter/X or her Discord. Twitter/X: @TheREALPurble  |   Discord: @realsparkly_keys
